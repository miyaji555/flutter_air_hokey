Welcome to our Flutter Flame Air Hockey Game! This game is developed using Flutter's powerful Flame engine.

## Overview
In this project, we have utilized Flutter and Flame for the client-side development of our air hockey game and the server-side system is elevated with the use of Dart Frog to construct a WebSocket server, enabling real-time communication for online gameplay.

One of the key achievements of this development is the use of Dart across both client and server sides, allowing for the unification of the Model class. This approach, by simplifying data handling, makes the development process more easy and enjoyable.


## Packages
The repository is organized into a multi-package structure, comprising three distinct packages: Client, Server, and Model. This modular approach facilitates easier maintenance, scalability, and understanding of the codebase, making it an ideal resource for developers interested in Flutter, Flame, and DartFrog integration.
